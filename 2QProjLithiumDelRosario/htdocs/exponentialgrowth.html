					<h1>Outrageous Challenges</h1>
					<p>What gold did MrBeast strike? Well, on the 1st of February 2016, MrBeast uploaded a video titled "Counting To 10000 In One Sitting,"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[1]</a></sup> where he (surprisingly) counted to 10000 in one sitting. Though this video didn’t get as many views as his other, more popular videos, namely, his <span class="italics">Worst Intros on YouTube</span> series of videos, <!--these videos are now deleted-->it became the first of many challenge videos that MrBeast uploaded.</p>
					<p>Besides that video, other challenge videos MrBeast uploaded around this time include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"100 LAYERS OF SARAN WRAP + TOILET PAPER!!"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[2]</a></sup></li>
						<li>"Reading The Entire Bee Movie Script But Everytime They Say "Bee" I Repeat All the Previous Bees"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[3]</a></sup></li>
						<li>"I Counted To 100,000!"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[4]</a></sup></li>
						<li>"Reading The Longest English Word (190,000 Characters)"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[5]</a></sup></li>
						<li>"Watching It's Everyday Bro For 10 Hours Straight"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[6]</a></sup></li>
					</ul>

					<h1>Viral Videos</h1>
					<p>Besides his challenge videos, other videos of his around this time went viral too. One of these videos is titled "Microwaving A Microwave,"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[7]</a></sup> the thumbnail of which is shown on the right, where Jimmy and his friend microwaved random objects suggested by his Twitter followers, such as eggs, bananas, aluminum foil, and another microwave. The virality of this video led Jimmy to make "sequels" of sorts to it.</p><!--These sequels had a similar premise to the original and slowly became more and more “meta,” like the video titled “Grilling [An Oven Baking] A Microwave Microwaving A Microwave Microwaving A Toaster Toasting An Iphone Watching Micro[waving A Microwave Microwaving A Toaster]”-->
					<div class="microwave"></div> <!--This animation is placed on the text side because I'm trying to make it so that my website has the same proportions when scaling up and down the width of the screen, and having this on the right side of a small screen might cause problems-->
					<p>Along with "Microwaving A Microwave," MrBeast’s "Reacting To The Reaction Of The Reaction To The Reaction Of The Reaction Of The Reaction To The Reac[…]"<sup><a href="sources.html#egsource" class="sup">[8]</a></sup>, the thumbnail of which is also shown on the right, similarly went viral. The video involved Jimmy reacting to a reaction of himself reacting to a reaction of himself… reacting to a reaction of himself reacting to Donald Trump and was posted on February 22, 2017, about a year after Jimmy counted to 10000.</p>
					<p>Around this time, Jimmy used both the money he earned from all of these viral videos and the money from sponsors for a good cause.</p> <!--This is when Jimmy starts giving away his money to others-->
