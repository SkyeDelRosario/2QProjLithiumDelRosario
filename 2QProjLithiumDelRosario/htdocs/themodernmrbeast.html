					<h1>Subscribe to PewDiePie</h1>
					<p>MrBeast chose PewDiePie’s side and decided to advertise in many different ways, from buying billboards and advertising on the radio<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[1]</a></sup>, to wearing promotional shirts at the Super Bowl<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[2]</a></sup> to get others to subscribe to PewDiePie so that T-Series, a channel run by an Indian company, doesn’t overtake the former in subscribers.</p>  <!--This is where PewDiePie plays a bigger part in MrBeast’s history.-->
					<p>Even though T-Series reached 100 million subscribers before PewDiePie did, <!--This was the “finish line” the two sides “agreed” upon to end the race--> MrBeast was able to get tens of millions of views on his videos and become friends with PewDiePie.</p>

					<h1>Last to Leave Challenges</h1>
					<p>On October 13, 2018, MrBeast uploaded a video titled "Last To Leave Circle Wins $10,000 - Challenge,"<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[3]</a></sup> the thumbnail of which is shown on the right, where four of his friends sit in a circle with the last person to leave winning $10,000. This video got many millions of views, considerably more than his other videos at the time. This led to the creation of more "Last To Leave" videos, and over time, several characters are noted to have been appearing in most, if not all of these videos, namely Chris and Chandler. Namely, Chandler was famous for not winning a single challenge up until the "Last To Leave Revolving Door Wins $50,000"<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[4]</a></sup> video. Chandler’s victory in said video led to the celebration of many of Jimmy’s viewers, including me!</p>

					<h1>TeamTrees</h1>
					<p>Many of Jimmy’s viewers wanted him to plant 20,000,000 trees in celebration of reaching 20 million subscribers to both combat climate change and raise awareness about the state of the Earth’s climate, so in a video made on October 26, 2019<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[5]</a></sup>, <!--This video was made almost a year after Jimmy advertised subscribing to PewDiePie-->Jimmy tried to make it happen and, with the help of Mark Rober and countless other YouTubers, launched an organization called TeamTrees<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[6]</a></sup>, where a $1 donation is able to plant one tree somewhere in the world, with the final goal being to plant over 20,000,000 trees. The project ended up being a success in the end, and Jimmy was able to launch another successful organization called TeamSeas<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[7]</a></sup> in late 2021.</p>  <!--TeamSeas’s goal was to take 30,000,000 pounds of trash out of the ocean a $1 donation at a time-->

					<h1>Branching Off</h1>
					<p>Recently, MrBeast has made four other major channels where he posts videos separate from those in the main channel. Below are those four channels ordered from oldest to newest:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Beast Reacts<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[8]</a></sup> (profile picture shown on the right) - was formerly a channel where Jimmy and his friends reacted to different kinds of life hacks but is now a reaction channel reacting to all kinds of videos</li>
						<li>MrBeast Gaming<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[9]</a></sup> - made for gaming videos and online-friendly challenges in games like Minecraft, among others, most of which are separate from challenges in the main channel</li>
						<li>MrBeast Shorts<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[10]</a></sup> - made for videos shorter than a minute and for YouTube’s new <span class="italics">YouTube Shorts</span> feature</li>
						<li>Beast Philanthropy<sup><a href="sources.html#tmmsource" class="sup">[11]</a></sup> - made for videos about helping people in need, all of the revenue from this channel go towards helping others</li>
