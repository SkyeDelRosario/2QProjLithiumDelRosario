					<h1>Acts of Charity</h1>
					<p>On June 17, 2017, MrBeast uploaded a video titled "Giving A Random Homeless Man $10,000"<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[1]</a></sup> where he gave $10,000 given to him by his sponsor <span class="italics">Quidd</span> to a homeless man. After this video, he uploaded several similar videos, involving him donating money to Twitch streamers<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[2]</a></sup> <!--This is the foreshadowing I mentioned in the Early Beginnings page-->and tipping money to pizza delivery guys<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[3]</a></sup> and Uber drivers<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
					<p>Among these videos, MrBeast also uploaded a video where was able to give $100,000 to his mom to thank her for raising him and his siblings on a day he calls "The Proudest Day of [His] Life"<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[5]</a></sup>. The thumbnail of this video is shown on the right.</p>
					<p>In the same vein, around this time, Jimmy made videos where he surprised every millionth subscriber of his with the same amount of random objects. For example, he gave his 3 millionth subscriber 3 million pennies<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[6]</a></sup>, his 4 millionth subscriber 4 million cookies<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[7]</a></sup>, and so on.</p>

					<h1>Multi-Million Views Per Video</h1>
					<p>Videos like the ones mentioned above and goofy ones where Jimmy and his friends try random experiments eventually start garnering millions of views. The YouTube revenue he earns from these views, along with the money he earns from his merch store<sup><a href="sources.html#ytpsource" class="sup">[8]</a></sup> is able to make him less reliant on sponsors like <span class="italics">Honey</span>, <span class="italics">Quidd</span>, mobile game companies, and more when doing his charity videos.</p>
					<p>The huge amounts of money he gets from these videos also help fund more expensive videos, which garner more and more views, skyrocketing MrBeast’s popularity across YouTube.</p>
					<p>On October 27, 2018, he promoted a side in the <span class="italics">PewDiePie vs. T-Series subscriber battle…</span></p><!--The side he promoted was PewDiePie’s, and this will be expanded upon on the next page!-->
